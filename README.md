Microbiome analysis of soil and root microbiome data of Arabidopsis thaliana plant sampled across two locations in Beijing, China.
Modelled after the publication on the best practices for microbiome analysis using R by Tao Wen et al. The best practices for microbiome analysis using R, protein cell (2023) 14, 713–725, doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/procel/pwad024

The goal of this analysis was to perform downstream microbiome analysis using the microeco package, released by Liu et al. (microeco: an R package for data mining in microbial community ecology). FEMS Microbiology Ecology, 2021, 97(2): fiaa255. https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiaa255
